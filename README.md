# Tony, a learning game developer.  
G'day, my name is Tony. I currently reside in Melbourne, Australia, studying computer science and games development.

## What are my interests? Glad you asked
- Reading (lots, and often on very uncanny subjects)
- Chatting with people about anything (I hope)
- Playing and making games
- Studying, because who doesn't love studying?

## My goals for 2022 🏆🏞
- Read 20 new books
- Become a math wizard
- Get a placement for my career! Scary!
- Expand my professional network until it has stretch marks
